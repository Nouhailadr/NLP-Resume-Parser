# NLP-Resume-Parser

Creating a resume parser and matching system is a valuable project idea. It can be used to streamline the hiring process and make it more efficient. Here are the key components and steps you would need to consider when building such a system:

## Data Collection:

Gather a diverse set of resumes and job descriptions for training and testing the system. This data will be crucial for machine learning.
## Data Preprocessing:

Clean and standardize the resume and job description text to make it suitable for analysis.
## Information Extraction:

Implement natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract relevant information from resumes. This includes extracting data such as contact information, skills, work experience, education, and more.
Keyword Matching:

Develop algorithms that identify relevant keywords and phrases from both the job description and the resume. These keywords can be used for matching.
## Machine Learning:

Train a machine learning model, possibly using techniques like Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text classification, to score the match between the extracted resume information and the job description.
## Scoring System:

Create a scoring system that quantifies how well a resume matches a job description. This could be based on keyword matches, skills overlap, experience relevance, and other factors.
## User Interface:

Build a user-friendly interface that allows recruiters or job seekers to upload resumes and job descriptions and view the matching scores.
